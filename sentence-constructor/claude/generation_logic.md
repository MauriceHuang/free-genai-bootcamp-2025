1. Summary of the prompt template:
The goal of the user who created this prompt is to design an AI Japanese language teacher that focuses on teaching short sentences and JLPT N5 level vocabulary. The teacher should guide students through recall exercises, provide constructive feedback, and gradually increase the use of Japanese in interactions. The emphasis is on helping students improve their language skills without giving direct answers.

2. Considerations for each variable:

USER_INPUT:
This would be written by a human end user (student). It would likely be a short sentence or question in Japanese, possibly with some errors. The input could be in Japanese, English, or a mix of both, depending on the student's level. Length would typically be one to three sentences.

JPLT_N5_VOCABULARY:
This would likely be extracted from a database or downloaded from an official JLPT resource website. It would contain a list of JLPT N5 level vocabulary words in Japanese, possibly with their English translations and parts of speech. The list could be quite long, potentially containing 100-200 words.

PROGRESS_TRACKER:
This would be generated and updated by the AI system based on previous interactions with the student. It would likely contain information about the student's performance, including vocabulary mastered, common mistakes, and areas for improvement. The format would be structured, possibly in a JSON-like format for easy parsing and updating.
