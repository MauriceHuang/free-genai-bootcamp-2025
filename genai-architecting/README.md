# Functional Requirements

1. **User Input Flow**:
   - User submits a query/request
   - Primary goal: Accept and process user input in a structured manner

2. **RAG (Retrieval Layer)**:
   - Functional Purpose: Enhance response accuracy by retrieving relevant context
   - Components:
     - Vector Database: Stores and retrieves semantically similar content
     - Internet Access: Fetches real-time information when needed
     - Prompt Cache: Stores previously successful prompts to improve efficiency

3. **Security & Validation Layer**:
   - Input GuardRail:
     - Validates and sanitizes user input
     - Prevents harmful or malicious prompts
     - Ensures input meets system requirements

4. **Processing Layer**:
   - Llama 70B (Large Language Model):
     - Core processing engine
     - 70 billion parameter model for high-quality text generation
     - Processes the enriched context from RAG with user query

5. **Quality Control Layer**:
   - Output GuardRail:
     - Validates response quality
     - Ensures safety and appropriateness
     - Filters out unwanted content

6. **Response Validation Flow**:
   - Response Checker:
     - Verifies accuracy and completeness
     - Ensures response meets user requirements
   - JSON Format Validator:
     - Validates structure of response
     - Ensures proper JSON formatting
     - Routes:
       - Valid responses: Sent to user
       - Invalid responses: Returned to Output GuardRail for reprocessing

7. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Invalid responses are recycled through the system
   - Continuous improvement through iteration
   - Maintains response quality standards

This architecture ensures:
- Reliable and accurate responses
- Safe and validated input/output
- Properly formatted data
- Quality control at multiple levels
- Continuous improvement through feedback loops
